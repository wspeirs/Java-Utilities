* com.bittrust.LockFreeArrayBlockingQueue *
This is an implementation of a Blocking Queue which uses an array and
AtomicIntegers to avoid any type of locking. If you run the associated speed
tests you'll find it's much faster than LinkedBlockingQueue and usually faster
than ArrayBlockingQueue when the container size is large enough.
